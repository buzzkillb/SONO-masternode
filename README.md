Use this instructions to install the wallet, fix wallet issues and setup one/multiple masternode(s).
This guide is for the creation of separate Controller Wallet & Masternode.
For Security reasons, THIS IS THE PREFERRED way to run a Masternode. By running your Masternode in this way you are protecting
your coins in your private wallet, and are not required to have your local wallet running after the Masternode has been started successfully.
Your coins will be safe if the masternode server gets hacked.
